# Auction Website Project

## Goal

The goal of this project is to leverage the skills acquired over the past three semesters to create a fully functional auction website. The website will allow users to add items for auction and bid on items listed by other users.

## Brief

The auction site envisions a platform where users, upon registration, are granted 1000 credits to engage in auctions. Credits can be earned by selling items and spent by purchasing items. Only registered users have the privilege to bid on listings, while non-registered users can browse through the available items.

## Requirements

This project focuses on the front-end application for the API, with all API functionalities managed by an existing application.

### User Stories

The client has outlined the following user stories:

- A user with a stud.noroff.no email may register.
- A registered user may log in.
- A registered user may log out.
- A registered user may update their avatar.
- A registered user may view their total credit.
- A registered user may create a listing with a title, deadline date, media gallery, and description.
- A registered user may add a bid to another user's listing.
- A registered user may view bids made on a listing.
- An unregistered user may search through listings.
